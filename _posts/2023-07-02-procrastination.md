When I last blogged here, I was spending a large amount of my free time on the _DevOpsChops_ side project. The project was taking shape incredibly quickly and I could see myself releasing it in a month or two with the progress being made. Since then, I've spent approximately zero time on it.

The original culprit was winning a Nintendo Switch. I considered giving it away, but first I just had to play _Breath of the Wild_ as it was heralded as one of the top games of all time. Turns it it's also a very time-consuming adventure to complete. That ate up almost a month of time. After that I somehow convinced myself that I needed to play some classic PC games as a form of "research" into improving the game aspect of _DevOpsChops_. Before I knew it I'd worked through the entire _BioShock_ series (all excellent), a number of puzzle games like _Braid_ and _Talos Principle_, and even a few VR games. 

I don't regret that I played these games but I do regret that I haven't spent any time on _DevOpsChops_. There are so many great video games out there and you could spend all your spare time playing them. They seemed to make me lazier, by providing big in-game rewards for straightforward and engaging goal-oriented work.

Worse, they seemed to sap my creative drive and made me despair of making something cool myself, as the level of craftmanship in games like _BioShock_ is just awe-inspiring making any indie effort look basic. I need to recognize that few experiences are going to compare to playing one of the top reviewed games ever produced by a large, renowed studio. And that's fine! There's a galaxy of space for all sorts of creations to exist and thrive in.

There's a regular pattern that myself and many of my friends fall into. We get obsessed by a particular side project or field of study for a while, before something else catches our fancy. In some ways this is an advantage; in the fast moving world of software it's good to always be experimenting with new technologies, and if a fixation is not particularly healthy (such as video games) it never seems to last too long.

But it also means that my hard drive and notebooks are full of half-finished projects. When I look through some of these projects, I think, it's not perfect but people would have liked it, I should have just released it! I'm determined not to let _DevOpsChops_ be one of those projects.
