Hello! I'm [Laurence](https://laurencetennant.com/), one of the co-founders of [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/). On my weekends I've been working on a similar fun platform for learning DevOps skills. This blog will chronicle my thoughts and roadblocks encountered on the way.

Current progress can be seen in [this post](https://devopschops.com/blog/devopschops-progress/).
